# Demo1-Pacman


The start of a series of examples that I am building to liven up my Github do demonstrate my capabilities as a Developer. 
=============================================

The goal of the application will be to re-create the pacman classic game. 

This was a simple project I had created a fews years back, I am in the process of adding more items onto my Github so I can publically show my capabilities as a developer.

This was an old project and I would have made a few changes currently. Might revisit the code to make a new version once I have finishes updating my Git
=============================================

Player Score Display: Intending to incorporate a persistent player score display on the GUI.

Dynamic Food Generation: Planning to implement food item generation through arrays, offering a more systematic approach than manual plotting.

Advanced Speed Control: Envisioning the addition of a sophisticated speed controller for increased gameplay dynamics. Considering the possibility for ghosts to alternate speeds, providing a more challenging experience. (Currently, game speed is adjusted using "/4.")

Superfood Feature: Intending to introduce a Superfood that grants Pacman temporary invulnerability, akin to the original game.

Objective of the Demo: The primary purpose of this demo is to showcase my future ability to employ mathematical calculations for game mechanics.
